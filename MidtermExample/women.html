        <p>When you think of programmers and computer scientists, <em>most</em> of the time you think of men. The reality is, some of the most important key players
        in the history of computing were in fact women. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC">The first modern computer</a>, using what is known as Von Neumann architecture, was
        programmed mostly by women, back when sending instructions to a computer meant plugging and unplugging cables in and out of
        the machine.In fact, it was a woman who determined the logical foundation behind how we write computer programs.</p>
        <p>So why, when we think of the history of computation and computer science, do we mostly think of men? In 1971, Linda Nochlin asked
        a similar question in her famous essay <cite>Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?</cite>. She concluded that the story being told is inherently gendered 
        and has effectively erased the achievements of women from this history.
        
        Above are links to 3 examples of women who are fundamental to the development of one of the world's greatest technological
        achievements. These three women represent  times in history where important technological and social achievements were made in computing. Their
        stories represent not only a testament to the ability of women to contribute to the field of science, but to the inequality in how
        their stories are being told.
