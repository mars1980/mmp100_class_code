<p><strong>Take note:</strong> Use the strong tag to indicate that a word
has extra importance.</p>

<p>The emphasis tag is used when we want to stress a particular word, ie place emphasis on
it. For example:</br>
I <em>love</em> chips and salsa.</br>
<em>I</em> love chips and salsa.</br>
I love chips <em>and</em> salsa.</p>
