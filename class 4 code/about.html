            <h2> short bio </h2>
            <img src="images/crys.png">
            <p>I grew up in South Carolina but have lived in Chicago,
            Los Angeles, and New York. I just graduated from NYU where
            I studied art, design, and technology. Before I got my Masters degree, I lived in Los Angeles
            as an artist and part time office manager. I went to undergraduate at Antioch University
            LA, where I studied art and philosophy. Since moving to New York, I've worked on hardware development
            projects for artists and even a hydroponics start up. I've also worked freelance as a videographer and
            technology consultant. I currently am a research fellow at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program and
            an Adjunct Professor at BMCC.</p>
            <p>I love hiking mountains, geology, space, and <em>especially</em> mars.
            In fact, my middle name is <q>Marcelle</q> which is Greek for <q>of Mars</q>. Most of my friends
            are serious nerds or make fun of me for being such a nerd. </p>
